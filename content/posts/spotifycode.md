## Spotify codes 

I love music and I spend most of my day listening to songs. Spotify codes caught my eye from past some days, so I went on finding how do they work. 
I thought I should share this journey, how even the maker of Spotify codes Ludvig Strigeus,(also the maker of utorrent)was involved.

> Spotify Codes are like QR-codes that can be generated to easily share Spotify songs, artists, playlists, and users.

## Spotify URIs	
Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.

A URI is a code you can use for embedding and searching within the Spotify app. Spotify URI codes look like this: 
>spotify:user:spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M. 

The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are 10 + 26 + 26 = 62 possibilities for each character (almost Base64). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is 62^22 which is equal to 2.7e39 which is a veryyy longgg digit so Spotify is not running out of these any time soon.

Spotify Codes 
When the bars are sorted by height you can see that there are 8 discrete heights that they fall into.

![spotify code with heights labeled](https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify-2/spotify_track_6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL_labeled.png)

Code 1
This is the sequence of the “Girl Of My Dreams” Spotify code:

> get_heights
[0, 5, 1, 2, 0, 6, 4, 3, 7, 1, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 1, 6, 3, 7, 0, 7, 0]

According to StackOverflow discussion,
The barcode consists of 23 bars, of which only 20 contain information. This means that there are 8^20 pieces of information that can be encoded into the code.

A media reference is first generated by Spotify for a Spotify URI(link to URI para).
The media reference is what gets encoded into the barcode and links the barcode to the URI. Spotify maintains a database of media references to URI mappings. Media references let Spotify track which codes are scanned, enable them to theoretically re-map codes, and just look better when encoded(which they successfully made it look, omg I love the aesthetics)


Simple no, no it isn't. There is a lot more which goes on in the background.
Problems :
- Big to small barcode URIs to barcode (The weird thing about this is the amount of information in the URI and the Spotify code do not match up.)
- Error correction 
- String encryption

Then it goes with CRC Calculation, Convolutional encoding, Decoding.  
Grey scale, omg stop imaging I know what you all are thinking greyscale disease from Game of thrones well that is not what is used here.


The media reference can be expressed as a 37 bit binary number:

```python
57639171874 -> 0100010011101111111100011101011010110
```

### CRC Calculation

Next, [cyclic redundancy check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) bits are calculated for the media reference. A CRC calculates check bits to verify the integrity of the data. (Tangent: another simple checksum algorithm we use every day to validate credit card numbers is the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).)

Spotify uses CRC-8 with the following generator:

```text
x^8 + x^2 + x + 1
```

Which gives us the following polynomial when fully written out:
```text
1x^8 + 0x^7 + 0x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 1x^2 + x + 1
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
```

The CRC is calculated by following these steps:
1. Pad with 3 bits on the right
```
01000100 11101111 11110001 11010110 10110000
```
2. Reverse bytes
```
00100010 11110111 10001111 01101011 00001101
```
3. Calculate CRC as normal (highest order degree on the left)
```
11001100
```
4. Reverse CRC
```
00110011
```
5. Invert check
```
11001100
```
6. Finally append to step 1 result
```
01000100 11101111 11110001 11010110 10110110 01100
|----------Media Ref--------------------||--CRC--|
```

Here is a simple version of a crc calculator (step 3):
```python
def crc(data, polynomial):
    # xor the data with the polynomial at each occurrence of 
    # a 1 in the data. Return the remainder as the checksum.
    n = len(polynomial) - 1
    initial_length = len(data)
    check_bits = data + [0] * n
    for i in range(initial_length):
        if check_bits[i] == 1:
            for j, p in enumerate(polynomial):
                check_bits[i + j] = check_bits[i + j] ^ p
    return check_bits[-n:]
```

We can use the check bits to verify that the contents of the data match what was intended by the "sender":

```python
def check_crc(data, polynomial, check_bits):
    full_data = data + check_bits
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if full_data[i] == 1:
            for j, p in enumerate(polynomial):
                full_data[i + j] = full_data[i + j] ^ p
    return 1 not in full_data
data = [0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1]
check = [1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]
poly = [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]
print(check_crc(data, poly, check))
# True
```

### Convolutional encoding

These 45 bits are then [convolutionally encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_code). Convolutional codes add redundancy to data to make it possible to decode the data if errors are introduced during transmission.

#### Tail biting

Before we start calculating the parity bits, we must prepend stream with last 6 bits of data:
```
01000100 11101111 11110001 11010110 10110110 01100
                                           |-----|

001100 01000100 11101111 11110001 11010110 10110110 01100
|----|
```
Another approach would be to prepend `0`s to the input, but Spotify chose to go with this tail-biting method.

#### Encoding

We can focus on one generator at a time. Below is a step by step walkthrough of how the parity bits are generated for `g0`. I reversed the polynomial because it is easier to display right to left in the example.

```
Bit #0
001100010001001110111111110001110101101011011001100
1101101 <- generator polynomial (mask)
-------
0001000 = 1 (xor the bits together)

Bit #1
001100010001001110111111110001110101101011011001100
 1101101 <- generator polynomial (mask)
 -------
 0100001 = 0 (xor the bits together)

Bit #2
001100010001001110111111110001110101101011011001100
  1101101 <- generator polynomial (mask)
  -------
  1100000 = 0 (xor the bits together)

Bit #3
001100010001001110111111110001110101101011011001100
   1101101 <- generator polynomial (mask)
   -------
   1000100 = 0 (xor the bits together)

Bit #4
001100010001001110111111110001110101101011011001100
    1101101 <- generator polynomial (mask)
    -------
    0001000 = 1 (xor the bits together)
```

Continue this to the end of the stream of input bits:
```
Bit #45
001100010001001110111111110001110101101011011001100
                                            1101101 <- generator polynomial (mask)
                                            -------
                                            1001100 = 1 (xor the bits together)
```

The result of encoding with the first generator, `g0`:
```
100011100111110100110011110100000010001001011
```
The result of encoding with `g1`:
```
110011100010110110110100101101011100110011011
```

Here is a (naive) algorithm for calculating the parity bits:
```python
def encode(bits: List[int], polynomial: List[int], tail_bite=False):
    """Convolutionally encode the stream of bits using the generator polynomial.
    If tail_bite == True, prepend the tail of the input. Otherwise use 0s to fill.
    """
    if tail_bite:
        tail = bits[-(len(polynomial) - 1):]
    else: 
        tail = [0 for i in range(len(polynomial) - 1)]
    full = tail + bits
    polynomial.reverse() # Reverse since we're working the other direction
    parity_bits = []
    for i in range(len(bits)):
        parity = 0
        for j in range(len(polynomial)):
            parity ^= full[i + j] * polynomial[j]
        parity_bits.append(parity)
    return parity_bits
```

These two parity bit sequences are then interleaved (abab...):
```
1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
result:
110100001111110000101110111100110100111100011010111001110001000101011000010110000111001111
```

#### Puncturing

At this point we have gone from 45 bits to 90 bits. The rate of this convolutional code is 1/2 (one input bit results in 2 parity bits).

A rate of 1/2 is actually somewhat __low__ for this application (see [this article](https://blog.qrstuff.com/2011/12/14/qr-code-error-correction) about QR code rates). The rate can be increased by "puncturing" the code. We can remove every third bit to increase the rate to 3/4:
```
110100001111110000101110111100110100111100011010111001110001000101011000010110000111001111
11 10 00 11 11 00 10 11 11 10 11 10 11 10 01 01 11 00 11 00 00 10 01 00 01 11 00 11 00 11
result:
111000111100101111101110111001011100110000100100011100110011
```
This is equivalent to puncturing the two parity bit sequences with the patterns `101` and `110` before interleaving. Puncturing is a nice, simple way to increase the rate of your code after you estimate the frequency of expected errors.


#### Permutation

Spotify then shuffles the data to spread out errors when a whole bar is lost:

> A shuffling process may be used to spread out the potential errors (e.g., if a whole bar/distance is missing). Instead of having the encoded bar lengths be consecutive, the lost bits are non-consecutive in the code word. This improves the chances for the forward error correction to work when a whole bar or distance is lost. Thus to scan the optical code, after the lengths of the found bars are converted into bits with certainties, the bits are shuffled back into the right order.

[source](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/20180181849.pdf)

The bits are permuted by choosing every 7th bit (modulo 60) from the input.

```python
def permute(bits, step=7):
    for i in range(len(bits)):
        yield bits[(i * step) % len(bits)]
```

Input and result:
```
111000111100101111101110111001011100110000100100011100110011
111100110001110101101000011110010110101100111111101000111000
```

#### Map to bar heights

Finally, map the bits to bar heights between 0 and 7 using [gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code):

Decimal|Binary|Gray
---|---|---
0|000|000
1|001|001
2|010|011
3|011|010
4|100|110
5|101|111
6|110|101
7|111|100

```
111 100 110 001 110 101 101 000 011 110 010 110 101 100 111 111 101 000 111 000
 5   7   4   1   4   6   6   0   2   4   3   4   6   7   5   5   6   0   7   0
```

Three additional bars are added as reference points at the start, end, and 12th position:
```
[0]5741466024[7]3467556070[0]
```


## Decoding

Let's reiterate why we went through the process of calculating the CRC and convolutionally encoding the data:
1. Convolutional codes allow us to correct for errors in a message by sending "redundant" bits with the message
2. The CRC lets the client check the validity of the decoded Spotify code. If the check bits are not correct, the client can scan the code again. When they are correct, then the client can ping Spotify's servers. As Ludvig says, "I chose to include a CRC to let the client have a way to more easily discard invalid codes without a backend roundtrip."

The process of transforming an image of a Spotify code to a media reference follows approximately the same steps as encoding in reverse. However, there is a much more happening while decoding a convolutional code.
